# BoardGames

This repository contains game descriptions for board games, in particular for playing "classical" games such as chess or checkers on unusual boards, such as cubes, cylinders, tori, MÃ¶bius strips and Klein bottles. The aim is to provide these in different rule description / programming languages, so that they can be played with general game playing software:
